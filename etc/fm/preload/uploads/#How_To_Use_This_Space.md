# How To Use This Space To Manage Your Files

The folder containing the file is the space where you can upload and organize files that will be part of your data publication.

### Quick Guide

  * To add files, drag-and-drop them into the folder window or click the "New+" button.
  * To add a subfolder, click on the "New+" button.
  * To move a file to a subfolder, drag-and-drop them on the subfolder icon.
  * To hide a file and keep it from being included it in the publication, move it to the "HIDE" subfolder.
  * To schedule a file for future automatic removal, move it to the "TRASH" subfolder.

## Disallowed and Ignored Files

A publication is prohibited from including any files that begin with "." or "#"; thus, any files uploaded into this space beginning with those characters will be ignored.

Files and folders called "HIDE" or "TRASH" will also be ignored.  Folders with these names can be placed into any subfolder, and they will behave just like the folders in the top-level uploads directory.
