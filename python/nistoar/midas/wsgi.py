"""
A module that assembles all of the different endpoints of the MIDAS API into one WSGI App.

The :ref:class:`MIDASApp` class is an WSGI application class that provides the suite of MIDAS services.  
Which services are actually made available depends on the configuration provided at construction time.  
See the :py:mod:`nistoar.midas.dbio.wsgi` module documentation for a description of the 
configuraiton schema.  In particular, :ref:class:`MIDASApp` application can provide, when so configured,
the following endpoints:

  * ``/dmp/mdm1/`` -- the Data Management Plan (DMP) Authoring API, for creating and editing DMPs
    (according to the "mdm1" convention)
  * ``/dap/mds3/`` -- the Digital Assets Publication (DAP) Authoring API, for drafting data and 
    software publications (according to the mds3 convention) to be submitted to the Public Data 
    Repository (PDR)
  * ``/groups/`` -- the API for creating and managing access permission groups for collaborative 
    authoring.
  * ``/nsdi/v1/`` -- an API for retrieving fast indexes matching entries in the NIST Staff Directory
    (see :py:mod:`nistoar.midas.nsdi` for details).

These endpoint send and receive data stored in the backend database through the common 
:py:mod:` DBIO layer <nistoar.midas.dbio>`.  

The app configuration determines which endpoints that are actually available.  The authoring API 
endpoints follow a common pattern:

   /_service_/_convention_/

where _service_ is MIDAS service name (like "dmp" or "dap") and _convention_ is name that represents 
the version of the service interface.  Usually, there is one convention available called "def", which 
serves as a synonym for the convention that is considered the default convention.  Through the 
configuration, it is possible, then, to create additional authoring services or conventions of services.  

The configuration that is expected by ``MIDASApp`` is a (JSON) object with the following properties:

``base_endpoint``
    (str) _optional_.  the URL resource path where the base of the base of the service suite is accessed.
    The default value is "/midas/".  An empty string is equivalent to "/", the root path.  
``strict``
    (bool) _optional_.  if False and if a service type (see below) given in this configuration is not 
    recognized, a ``ConfiguraitonException`` will be raised.
``about``
    (object) _optional_.  an object of data describing this suite of services that should be returned 
    when the base path is requested.  (See the :py:class:`~nistoar.midas.dbio.wsgi.wsgiapp.About` class 
    for an example.)  There are no requirements on the properties in this object except that it should 
    _not_ include "services" or "versions".  
``services``
    (object) _required_.  an object in which each property is a service name (as referred to above in 
    the API endpoint pattern--e.g., "dmp" or "dap"), and its value is the configuration for that service.
``dbio``
    (object) _recommended_.  an object that provides configuration for the DBIO client; typically, this 
                          includes a ``factory`` property whose string value identifies the type of 
                          backend storage to use ("mongo", "fsbased", or "inmem").  The other properties
                          are the parameters that are specific to the backend storage.
``jwt_auth``
    (object) an object that provides configuration related to JWT-based authentication to the service
    endpoints.  If set, a JWT token (presented via the Authorization HTTP header) will be used to 
    determine the client user identity and attributes; if a token is not included with requests, the 
    user will be set to "anonymous".  If this configuration is not set, all client users will be 
    considered anonymous.  

The supported subproperties for ``jwt_auth`` are as follows:

``key``
    (str) _required_.  The secret key shared with the token generator (usually a separate service) used to 
    encrypt the token.

``algorithm``
    (str) _optional_.  The name of the encryption algorithm to encrypt the token.  Currently, only one value 
    is support (the default): "HS256".

``require_expiration``
    (bool) _optional_.  If True (default), any JWT token that does not include an expiration time will be 
    rejected, and the client user will be set to anonymous.

Most of the properties in a service configuration object will be treated as default configuration 
parameters for configuring a particular version, or _convention_, of the service.  Convention-level 
configuration will be merged with these properties (overriding the defaults) to produce the configuration 
that is passed to the ServiceApp that handles the service.  The properties supported are service-specific.
In addition to the service-specific properties, three special-purpose properties are supported:

``about``
    (object) _optional_.  an object of data describing the service catagory that should be returned 
    when the service name endpoint is requested.  (See the 
    :py:class:`~nistoar.midas.dbio.wsgi.wsgiapp.About` class for an example.)  There are no requirements 
    on the properties in this object except that it should _not_ include "services" or "versions".  
``conventions``
    (object) _optional_.  an object in which each property is a convention name supported for the service
    (as referred to above in the API endpoint pattern--e.g., "mdm1" for the DMP service), and its value is 
    the configuration for that convention (i.e. version) of the service.  Any properties given here 
    override properties of the same name given at the service level, as discussed above.  The properties
    can be service- or convention-specific, apart from the required property, ``type`` (defined below).  
``default_convention``
    (str) _optional_.  the name of the convention (one of the names specified as a property of the 
    ``conventions`` field described above) that should be considered the default convention.  If a client
    requests the special convention name "def", the request will be routed to the version of the service 
    with that name.  

There are a few common properties that can appear in either the service or convention level (or both, where 
the convention level takes precedence): 

``type``
    (str) _optional_.  a name that serves as an alias for the Python ``ServiceApp`` class that implements 
    the service convention.  The default value is the service and convention names combined as 
    "_service_/_convention_".  
``project_name``
    (str) _optional_.  a name indicating the type of DBIO project the service manages.  This name 
    corresponds to a DBIO project collection name.  If provided, it will override the collection used 
    by default ``ServiceApp`` specified by the ``type`` parameter.  
``clients``
    (object) _required_.  the configuration parameters restrict the scope of the clients that connect to 
    the web service.  This is passed to the :py:class:`~nistoar.midas.dbio.project.ProjectService` 
    configured for the convention.
``dbio``
    (object) _recommended_.  the configuration parameters for the DBIO client which are specific to the 
    project service type (see below).  In particular, this includes the authorization configurations;
    see the :py:mod:`dbio module documentation <nistoar.midas.dbio>` for this schema. This is passed to 
    the :py:class:`~nistoar.midas.dbio.project.ProjectService` configured for the convention.

In addition to providing the :ref:class:`MIDASApp` class, this module provides a mechanism for plugging 
in addition _project_ services, particularly new conventions of services.  The class constructor takes 
an optional dictionary parameter that provides in its values the 
:ref:class:`~nistoar.pdr.publish.service.wsgi.ServiceApp` class that implements a particular DBIO project
service.  The keys labels that correspond to the ``type`` parameter in the 
:py:mod:`configuration <nistoar.midas.dbio.wsgi>` and which, by default, have the form 
_service_/_convention_ (e.g. ``dmp/mdm1``).  If this dictionary is not provided to the constructur, an 
default defined in this module, ``_MIDASServiceApps`` is used.  Thus, the normal way to add a new service 
implementation to the suite is to add it to the internal ``_MIDASServiceApps`` dictionary.  

This module also provides two other classes that are used internally to initialize a :ref:class:`MIDASApp` 
instance: :ref:class:`ServiceAppFactory` and :ref:class:`About`.  :ref:class:`ServiceAppFactory` is used 
within :ref:class:`MIDASApp` to instantiate all of the ``ServiceApp`` classes given in the above mentioned 
dictionary; however, it also provides functions to instantiate a ``ServiceApp`` individually and to extract
the configuration parameters needed to do that instantiation.  :ref:class:`About` is a ``ServiceApp`` that 
returns through the web interface information about the MIDAS services.  :ref:class:`ServiceAppFactory`
injects instances of this class into :ref:class:`MIDASApp` to respond to GET requests on the MIDAS 
service's parent resources.
