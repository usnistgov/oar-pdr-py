        Agent (where the ``agent_class`` is set to "invalid") is returned, depending on the 
        configuration.  Also depending on the configuration, if no usr credentials are presented,
        either the exception is raised or an Agent.ANONYMOUS identity is returned.  

        This implementation will check for client application identifier which is expected to be 
        provided via the ``OAR-client-id`` HTTP header.  Clients may also provide a list of delegated 
        agents via the ``OAR-client-agents`` header; the agent identifiers should be space-separated.

            a map whose keys are secret client keys and, and each value is a list of agent 
            identifiers corresponding to the agents that were assigned this identifier.  The list 
            represents the agent delegation that was expected to have occured on the client side 
            leading to the current request.  This list will be set as the returned 
            :py:class:`~nistoar.pdr.utils.prov.Agent`'s ``delegated`` property.  If not 
            provided, this will default to the value of the presented client ID.  

        ``allowed_clients``
            a list of client identifiers that should be considered allowed to use this service.  If 
            this parameter is not set, the ``OAR-client-id`` HTTP header is not required to be set, 
            and all clients will be allowed.  Otherwise, the ``OAR-client-id`` value must be in the 
            this list or the authentication will be considered invalid. 

        ``raise_on_invalid``
            set to True if an exception should be raised if the credentials presented are found to 
            be invalid (this includes if client ID is not in the ``allowed_clients`` parameter).
            The default False will cause an Agent to be returned whose ``agent_class`` is set to
