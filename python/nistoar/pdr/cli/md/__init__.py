CLI command suite for accessing metadata from the PDR public metadata service.  See 
:py:module:`nistoar.pdr.cli` and the :program:`pdr` script for info on the general CLI infrastructure.

This module defines a set of subcommands to a commmand called (by default) "md".  These subcommands
include
  - ``recover``:  extract NERDm records from the public archival information packages (e.g. so that they 
    can be reloaded into the metadata database).

See also :py:module:`nistoar.pdr.describe.cmd` for the ``describe`` command.
