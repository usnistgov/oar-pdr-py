"""
CLI command suite for transforming NERDm records, including to different formats.  See 
:py:module:`nistoar.pdr.cli` and the :program:`pdr` script for info on the general CLI infrastructure.

This module defines a set of subcommands that identify the type of transformed output to create.  These
include:
  - ``latest``:  transform a NERDm record to use the most up to date schemas used by the PDR
  - ``rmm``:     transform a NERDm record into a three-component record appropriate for ingesting into the RMM.

See also :py:module:`nistoar.pdr.describe.cmd` for the ``describe`` command.
