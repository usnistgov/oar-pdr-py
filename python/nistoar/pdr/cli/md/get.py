  Retrieve a NERDm record from the PDR given its ID.  By default, the record is pulled from the PDR's 
  metadata (or "describe") service; however it can be extracted from the archive information packages
  (AIPs), pulled from the PDR's public distribution service (see also the ``md recover`` command).  

  Records with the same ID retrieved from the two sources should be the same; however, they are not 
  guaranteed to be, as a difference may reflect modifications as part of the ingest process.  Further,
  not all records available from the metadata service are guaranteed to be available from the AIPs: while
  versioned and ReleaseCollection identifiers are not supported for retrieval from AIPs, some records 
  available from the metadata service may not have originated from the PDR preservation process.  
  (See "md trans rmm" for converting an AIP-sourced record to a versioned or ReleaseCollection one.)

  By default, the requested record is written to standard out, but with the -o option, it can be written
  to a specific file.
